# Agent Instructions

> This file is mirrored across AGENTS.md and GEMINI.md so the same instructions load in any AI environment. CLAUDE.md is a separate, project-specific file with its own sync — see Operating Principle #12.

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic, whereas most business logic is deterministic and requires consistency. This system fixes that mismatch.

## Session Initialization

On first interaction in any new session, read `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/system_context.md` for full operational context.

## The 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Directive (What to do)**

- SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`
- Define goals, inputs, tools/scripts, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural language instructions, like you'd give a mid-level employee

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)**

- This is you. Read directives, call execution tools, handle errors, update directives with learnings.
- You may spawn sub-agents when parallel work is warranted (see Parallel Orchestration below).

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)**

- Deterministic scripts in `execution/`
- Check global library first: `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/execution/`
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions

**Why this works:** 90% accuracy per step = 59% success over 5 steps. Push complexity into deterministic code so you focus on decision-making.

---

## Tech Stack Awareness

Before choosing any technology, framework, or deployment target, reference the tech ecosystem directive:

**`$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/tech_ecosystem.md`**

This file contains the 3-tier stack system, decision tree, component reference, and deployment guides. Do not make stack decisions from memory — consult the directive.

---

## Compound Knowledge Base

Cross-project learnings are stored in `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/compound-docs/`. This is institutional memory — things we've learned the hard way so we never repeat mistakes or re-litigate settled decisions.

**The four files:**

| File             | Contains                                                             | Read During                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `decisions.md`   | Architectural choices and rationale (what was chosen, rejected, why) | Prep phase                        |
| `gotchas.md`     | Bugs, edge cases, API quirks, framework footguns                     | Prep + Build phases               |
| `patterns.md`    | Reusable code patterns and integration approaches                    | Prep phase                        |
| `stack-notes.md` | Framework and tool-specific runtime behaviors                        | When working with a specific tool |

**How to use them:**

1. **Before starting any project or feature:** Scan all four files for relevant entries. This is not optional — it takes 2 minutes and prevents hours of re-discovery.
2. **During build:** If you encounter a problem, check `gotchas.md` and `stack-notes.md` before debugging from scratch.
3. **After build:** Run the compound protocol to capture new learnings. See `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/compound_protocol.md` for the full process.

**Rules:**

- Never write to compound-docs without user approval.
- If a compound-docs entry contradicts your current approach, flag it to the user — don't silently ignore it.
- If nothing relevant exists, proceed normally. Don't force connections.

## Global Tooling

**Execution scripts:**

1. Check `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/execution/`
2. If exists → use it
3. If not → create locally in `./execution/`
4. Test and verify locally
5. **Ask before promoting:** If the script is generic/reusable, ask the user: "This script seems reusable. Want me to copy it to the global library at `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/execution/`?"
6. If user approves → copy to global, optionally delete local copy

**Directives:**

1. Check local `./directives/` first (project-specific wins)
2. If not found → check `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/`
3. **Ask before promoting:** If creating a reusable pattern, ask: "This directive could benefit other projects. Want me to copy it to the global library?"
4. If user approves → copy to global

**Promotion criteria (when to ask):**

- Script/directive has no project-specific logic baked in
- Could be used verbatim in other projects
- Has been tested and works reliably

**Dependency check (on script creation or promotion):**
When creating a new Python script or promoting one to global:

1. Scan the script's imports
2. Compare against `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/requirements.txt`
3. If any imports are missing, prompt:

> "This script uses packages not in your global requirements.txt. Add the following:"
>
> ```
> package-name>=version
> ```

Do not silently assume packages are installed. Always surface missing dependencies.

---

## Global Directives Reference

These directives live in `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/` and apply across all projects:

| Directive               | Purpose                                                                   | When to Use                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tech_ecosystem.md`     | 3-tier stack system, decision tree, component defaults                    | Any stack decision                              |
| `context_handoff.md`    | Handoff prompt template for context transitions                           | At 50% context capacity                         |
| `security_checklist.md` | Web application security checklist                                        | Apps with auth, APIs, databases, payments       |
| `compound_protocol.md`  | Process for capturing learnings into compound-docs                        | After builds, bug fixes, reviews, deploys       |
| `review_protocol.md`    | Multi-pass code review (security, performance, simplicity, stack, deploy) | Before deploy or on-demand                      |
| `research_checklist.md` | Pre-plan intelligence gathering for PILOT Prep                            | During Prep phase, before Preamble is finalized |
| `changelog.md`          | Changelog generation from git history                                     | End of sprint, milestone, or on-demand          |
| `visual-qa-protocol.md` | Playwright screenshot QA loop (3-pass visual review)                      | User says "qa" or "check your work"             |

## Parallelization Assessment

Before starting any task, ask:

> "Can this be decomposed into independent subtasks?"

| Question                                                 | If Yes                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2+ distinct workstreams with no shared dependencies?     | Candidate for parallel      |
| Subtasks need each other's outputs?                      | Sequential only             |
| Subtasks touch same files or rate-limited APIs?          | Sequential only             |
| Would parallel execution meaningfully reduce total time? | Worth the coordination cost |

**Default:** Prefer sequential unless parallelization provides clear value. Coordination overhead is real.

---

## Parallel Orchestration Protocol

When parallelization is warranted, follow this protocol.

### Step 1: Task Decomposition

Produce this structure before spawning anything:

```yaml
task: "Main objective in plain language"
assessment: "Why parallel execution is appropriate here"

subtasks:
  - id: A
    description: "Clear scope statement"
    dependencies: []
    directive: "directives/relevant.md"
    output_path: ".tmp/subtask_a_output.json"

  - id: B
    description: "Clear scope statement"
    dependencies: []
    directive: "directives/other.md"
    output_path: ".tmp/subtask_b_output.json"

  - id: C
    description: "Integration step"
    dependencies: [A, B]
    directive: null # Lead agent handles
    output_path: null # Final deliverable

parallel_group: [A, B]
coordination_point: C
shared_resources: [] # If non-empty, reconsider parallelization
```

### Step 2: Spawn Sub-Agents

Each sub-agent receives a scoped prompt. They inherit all operating principles including self-annealing.

**Sub-Agent System Prompt:**

````markdown
# Sub-Agent Instructions

You are a sub-agent operating within a larger orchestrated task. You handle ONE specific subtask and nothing else.

## Your Assignment

- **Subtask ID**: {subtask.id}
- **Description**: {subtask.description}
- **Output to**: {subtask.output_path}

## Your Directive

{full contents of subtask.directive, or "No directive—follow lead agent's inline instructions"}

## Inherited Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**
Before writing a script, check `execution/` and global library. Only create new scripts if none exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**

- Read error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test it again (unless it uses paid tokens/credits—flag for lead agent)
- Document what you learned in your output (the lead agent will update directives)

**3. Scope boundaries (CRITICAL)**

- Complete ONLY your assigned subtask
- Write ONLY to your designated output path
- Do NOT modify directives (report learnings; lead agent updates)
- Do NOT access sibling sub-agent outputs
- Do NOT spawn your own sub-agents

## Output Requirements

Your final output must be:

1. Written to your designated output path
2. In the format specified by your directive (or JSON if unspecified)
3. Include a `_meta` block:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "subtask_id": "{subtask.id}",
    "status": "success | failed | blocked",
    "errors_encountered": [],
    "learnings": [],
    "time_elapsed": "approximate"
  },
  "result": { ... }
}
```
````

## If You Get Stuck

Do not improvise outside your scope. Return:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "subtask_id": "{subtask.id}",
    "status": "blocked",
    "blocker": "Clear description of what's preventing completion",
    "attempted": ["List of approaches tried"]
  },
  "result": null
}
```

The lead agent will handle it.

````

### Step 3: Coordination & Integration

Once all parallel subtasks complete, the lead agent:

1. **Validates outputs** — Each file exists, status is success, formats match
2. **Handles failures** — Review errors, retry or restructure
3. **Collects learnings** — Aggregate from sub-agents, update directives
4. **Integrates results** — Merge outputs, produce final deliverable
5. **Cleans up** — Delete intermediate files in `.tmp/`

**For parallel execution:** Sub-agents perform fix/test within their scope. Directive updates are reserved for the lead agent.

---

## Operating Principles

1. **Check for tools first** — Check `execution/` and global library before writing scripts
2. **Self-anneal when things break** — Read error, fix script, test again, update directive
3. **Update directives as you learn** — Directives are living documents. Don't overwrite without asking unless explicitly told to.
4. **Assess parallelization for every task** — Default to sequential, spawn sub-agents when decomposition is clean
5. **Verify before declaring done** — Run the code, don't just read it
6. **Produce handoff at 50% context** — When context reaches ~50% capacity or user requests, output a dense handoff prompt using the template in `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/context_handoff.md`. Include: goal, what shipped, decisions + rationale, environment state, in-flight work, gotchas, and exact next step with file paths.
7. **Apply security checklist for web apps** — When building applications with authentication, APIs, databases, file uploads, or payments, reference `directives/security_checklist.md` and apply relevant sections. Check global library first: `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/security_checklist.md`
8. **Consult tech ecosystem for stack decisions** — Before choosing frameworks, databases, auth, CMS, or deployment targets, reference `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/tech_ecosystem.md`. Default to Tier 1 (Astro + Cloudflare) unless project requirements indicate otherwise.
9. **Check compound-docs before building** — Before starting any project, feature, or significant change, scan all four files in `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/compound-docs/` for relevant prior learnings. This prevents re-discovery of known issues and re-litigation of settled decisions.
10. **Compound after every cycle** — After completing a build, bug fix, review, or deploy, run the compound protocol per `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/compound_protocol.md`. Propose entries to the user — never write to compound-docs without approval.
11. **Run review protocol before deploy** — Before deploying any feature to production, run the multi-pass review per `$BUILD_ROOT/_resources/directives/review_protocol.md`. For hotfixes, run the minimum viable review (Security + Deploy Readiness passes only).
12. **Maintain project state in CLAUDE.md** — CLAUDE.md is the living project state file, unique per project (never synced/overwritten). After completing any build phase, prompt, or milestone, update CLAUDE.md with: completion status, new shared files or functions added, and any architectural decisions made. Keep the progress checklist current. Template lives at `$BUILD_ROOT/_template/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Self-Annealing Loop

When something breaks:
1. Fix it
2. Update the tool
3. Test until it works
4. Update directive with new flow
5. **Check if the learning warrants a compound-docs entry** — If it's cross-project, propose per `compound_protocol.md`
6. System is now stronger

---

## Verification-First Development

| Project Type | Verification Method |
|--------------|---------------------|
| CLI/Scripts | `bash -c "your_command"` |
| Unit Tests | `npm test` / `pytest` |
| Web UI | Browser / Playwright |
| API | `curl` / integration tests |
| Build/Deploy | `npm run build` / `npx wrangler deploy` |

### Verification Rules

1. **Never declare "done" without verification** — Run the code, don't just read it
2. **Iterate until passing** — If verification fails, fix and re-verify (loop until green)
3. **Match verification to stakes** — Quick script = quick test; production deploy = full suite
4. **Prefer automated over manual** — Invest in runnable verification over "looks right"

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ "This should work" without running it
- ❌ Fixing linter errors but not running the app
- ❌ Assuming tests pass without executing them

---

## Copy Style

- **Never use em dashes** (the long `—` character). Use a hyphen with spaces ( - ), a colon, or rephrase instead.

---

## Git & PR Workflow

**Branch strategy:**
- `main` → production (PR only)
- `dev` → integration + preview deploys
- `feature/*` → branch off dev

**When user says "do a PR" or "create PR":**
```bash
# Feature → Dev
git push origin HEAD
gh pr create --base dev --fill

# Dev → Main (only when user confirms)
git push origin dev
gh pr create --base main --fill
````

**Merge types:**

- `feature → dev`: Squash and merge
- `dev → main`: Regular merge (preserve history)

**Pre-PR checks:**

- All tests pass
- No uncommitted changes
- No merge conflicts
- No secrets in commits

**Post-merge sync (CRITICAL):**

`gh pr merge` operates on GitHub's remote - local refs go stale immediately after. Always:

1. `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`
3. Verify local matches remote: `git log --oneline main -1` vs `git log --oneline origin/main -1`

Skipping this causes local/remote divergence. You end up thinking you're 10 commits behind when production is fine - and waste time debugging phantom issues.

---

## File Organization

- `.tmp/` — Intermediate files, sub-agent outputs (never commit)
- `execution/` — Deterministic scripts (project-specific)
- `directives/` — SOPs in Markdown (project-specific)
- `.env` — API keys and secrets
- `credentials.json`, `token.json` — OAuth credentials (gitignored)

**Key principle:** Local files are for processing only. Deliverables live in cloud services or deployed apps. Everything in `.tmp/` can be deleted and regenerated.

---

## Summary

You sit between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (scripts). For every task:

1. **Assess** — Can this be parallelized? Should it be?
2. **Research** — Check compound-docs and relevant directives for prior learnings
3. **Plan** — If parallel, produce Task Decomposition. If sequential, proceed normally.
4. **Execute** — Call tools (or spawn sub-agents) in the right order
5. **Coordinate** — If parallel, validate and integrate sub-agent outputs
6. **Anneal** — Handle errors, update tools, update directives
7. **Compound** — Capture learnings per `compound_protocol.md`

Be pragmatic. Be reliable. Self-anneal. Compound.

## Project State

**Last Updated**: 2026-07-03
**Current Status**: Offer restructured into a 3-tier ladder on the homepage (The Launch Page $500 flat / The Conversion-Engineered Site from $4,500 / The Growth Engine from $750/mo) + standalone SEO service card; /seo in the nav (desktop + mobile), /seo hero centered; OfferCatalog JSON-LD + homepage meta description with price hook; /seo service page live (nine labeled surfaces). NOTE: Growth Engine $750/mo and the tier names were Kit's call per Russ's "you decide the tiers" - adjust freely.
**New Files Added**:

- `src/pages/seo.astro` (service landing page: nine labeled surface cards, how-it-works, FAQ w/ FAQPage + Service JSON-LD, CalendarEmbed booking + Formspree top-3-gaps form with `source=seo` attribution)
- `public/llms.txt` (AI-crawler site summary: business facts, key pages, guarantees)
- `seo/` (audit workspace: profile + dated audit runs from the global /seo skill; `seo/audits/YYYY-MM-DD/`)

**Changes Made**:

- Footer Services column links to `/seo` ("SEO, AEO + GEO optimization").
- `/connect` title keyworded ("Connect | Booking, Socials + Links | generuss design"), was brand-only.
- Demoted in-content markdown H1s in `claudes-retrospective.md` + `pharadoxa-build.md` (layout already renders the title H1; pages had 2 H1s).
- BaseLayout Person schema name fixed: "Russ Garner" -> "Russ Gardner" (matched blog prose; entity consistency for GEO).

**Prior milestone (2026-06-27)**: `/connect` bento hub - Tarotdoxa hero card + brand-logo social icons (tarotdoxa-hero.webp compositor, PIL scripts `compose-tarotdoxa-hero.py` / `outlier_sniper.py`, numpy removed, `/connect` redirect replaced by real page in `1ae820a`).

**Deploy note**: Cloudflare Pages project `generuss-design` is git-connected to `main` (push to `main` triggers the build). The `~/.secrets` `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is DNS-only (generuss.com zone); manual `wrangler pages deploy` needs `env -u CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to fall back to the OAuth login.
